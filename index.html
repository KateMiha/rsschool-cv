      <p>What should a Junior Developer Resume contain?</p>
      <p>! Important: write your Resume in English if you can, if possible</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First Name, Last Name (real ones)</li>
        <li>Contact Info (add several ways to contact you)</li>
        <li>Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
        Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
        learning new things from everywhere etc.).</li>
        <li>Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)</li>
        <li>Code examples (LATEST)</li>
        <li>Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
        freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
        Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)</li>
        <li>Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)</li>
        <li>English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)</li>
      </ul>
